# EXERCISE 1 - Use principal component analysis to improve the classification of subjective experience  

We will use the same files as we did in Assignment 3
The files `megmag_data.npy` and `pas_vector.npy` can be downloaded here (http://laumollerandersen.org/data_methods_3/megmag_data.npy) and here (http://laumollerandersen.org/data_methods_3/pas_vector.npy)  
The function `equalize_targets` is supplied - this time, we will only work with an equalized data set. One motivation for this is that we have a well-defined chance level that we can compare against. Furthermore, we will look at a single time point to decrease the dimensionality of the problem  

1) Create a covariance matrix, find the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues
    i. Load `megmag_data.npy` and call it `data` using `np.load`. You can use `join`, which can be imported from `os.path`, to create paths from different string segments 
```{python}
#import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression 
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score 
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold 


#load data
data = np.load("/Users/rikkeuldbaek/Desktop/Cognitive Science/3rd semester/Methods 3/github_methods_3/week_08/megmag_data.npy")

y = np.load("/Users/rikkeuldbaek/Desktop/Cognitive Science/3rd semester/Methods 3/github_methods_3/week_08/pas_vector.npy")
```


ii. Equalize the number of targets in `y` and `data` using `equalize_targets`  
```{python}
#defined function to equalize number of targets in y and data
def equalize_targets(data, y):
    np.random.seed(7)
    targets = np.unique(y)
    counts = list()
    indices = list()
    for target in targets:
        counts.append(np.sum(y == target))
        indices.append(np.where(y == target)[0])
    min_count = np.min(counts)
    first_choice = np.random.choice(indices[0], size=min_count, replace=False)
    second_choice = np.random.choice(indices[1], size=min_count, replace=False)
    third_choice = np.random.choice(indices[2], size=min_count, replace=False)
    fourth_choice = np.random.choice(indices[3], size=min_count, replace=False)
    
    new_indices = np.concatenate((first_choice, second_choice,
                                 third_choice, fourth_choice))
    new_y = y[new_indices]
    new_data = data[new_indices, :, :]
    
    return new_data, new_y

#equalizing (overwriting) the data, so I have 98 elements of each PAS rating
data, y = equalize_targets(data, y)
data.shape #98 elements of each PAS rating in depth
y.shape #98 elements of each PAS rating in depth
```


iii. Construct `times=np.arange(-200, 804, 4)` and find the index corresponding to 248 ms - then reduce the dimensionality of `data` from three to two dimensions by only choosing the time index corresponding to 248 ms (248 ms was where we found the maximal average response in Assignment 3) 
```{python}
# Construct `times=np.arange(-200, 804, 4)`  (make a vector from -200 to 800, with a value each 4th millisecond)
times = np.arange(-200, 804, 4)


#the index corresponding to 248 ms
np.where(times == 248) # index 112

# reduce the dimensionality of `data` from three to two dimensions by only choosing the time index corresponding to 248 ms
data= data[:,:,112] 
data.shape # two dimensions now
```


iv. Scale the data using `StandardScaler` 
```{python}
#standardizing the data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
scaled_data.shape
```


v. Calculate the sample covariance matrix for the sensors (you can use `np.cov`) and plot it (either using `plt.imshow` or `sns.heatmap` (`import seaborn as sns`))  
```{python}
# Create the sensor covariance matrix 
cov_mat = np.cov(scaled_data.T)

#plot the cov_mat for the sensors (102 per axis)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.imshow(cov_mat,cmap = "hot")
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Sample covariance matrix for the 102 sensors ")
plt.xlabel('sensors')
plt.ylabel('sensors')
plt.show()
```


vi. What does the off-diagonal activation imply about the independence of the signals measured by the 102 sensors? 

The off-diagonal activation imply that the 102 sensors do not really pick up independent signals. We see a lot of positive co-variation, which indicates a positive relationship, i.e. when one sensor deviates from the mean, then the other co-variated sensor deviates in the same direction.

 *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
 
```{python}

```


vii. Run `np.linalg.matrix_rank` on the covariance matrix - what integer value do you get? (we'll use this later)  

When using the `np.linalg.matrix_rank` on my covariance matrix I get the integer value 97. 

```{python}
#Run `np.linalg.matrix_rank` on the covariance matrix 
int_val = np.linalg.matrix_rank(cov_mat)
print("The integer value is", int_val)
```


viii. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix using `np.linalg.eig` - note that some of the numbers returned are complex numbers, consisting of a real and an imaginary part (they have a _j_ next to them). We are going to ignore this by only looking at the real parts of the eigenvectors and -values. Use `np.real` to retrieve only the real parts 
```{python}
#Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix using `np.linalg.eig`
from numpy.linalg import eig as eigenValuesAndVectors

eigen_values, eigen_vectors = eigenValuesAndVectors(cov_mat)

# Due to complexity of the numbers, use `np.real` to retrieve only the real parts 
eigen_values = np.real(eigen_values)
eigen_vectors = np.real(eigen_vectors)
```

2) Create the weighting matrix $W$ and the projected data, $Z$
i. We need to sort the eigenvectors and eigenvalues according to the absolute values of the eigenvalues (use `np.abs` on the eigenvalues).  
```{python}
#use `np.abs` on the eigenvalues
eigen_values= np.abs(eigen_values)
```

ii. Then, we will find the correct ordering of the indices and create an array, e.g. `sorted_indices` that contains these indices. We want to sort the values from highest to lowest. For that, use `np.argsort`, which will find the indices that correspond to sorting the values from lowest to highest. Subsequently, use `np.flip`, which will reverse the order of the indices.   

```{python}
#find the correct ordering of the indices and create an array, e.g. `sorted_indices` that contains these indices.
sorted_indices= np.argsort(eigen_values)
sorted_indices = np.flip(sorted_indices) #lowest to highest
sorted_indices
```


iii. Finally, create arrays of sorted eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the `sorted_indices` array just created. For the eigenvalues, it should like this `eigenvalues = eigenvalues[sorted_indices]` and for the eigenvectors: `eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, sorted_indices]`


```{python}
#create arrays of sorted eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the `sorted_indices` array just created
eigen_values = eigen_values[sorted_indices]
eigen_vectors = eigen_vectors[:,sorted_indices]
```


iv. Plot the log, `np.log`, of the eigenvalues, `plt.plot(np.log(eigenvalues), 'o')` - are there some values that stand out from the rest? In fact, 5 (noise) dimensions have already been projected out of the data - how does that relate to the matrix rank (Exercise 1.1.vii)  

Yes 5 values stand out from the rest. When looking at the sorted_indices it is evident that the last 5 values are much more negative (-35 to -39) than the rest 97 values.
 *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*

```{python}
#plot the log of the eigenvalues
plt.figure()
plt.plot(np.log(eigen_values), 'rx')
plt.title("np.log of eigen values'")
plt.ylabel("log(eigen values)")
plt.xlabel("principle components")
plt.show()

#logged version for interpretation
log_eigen = np.log(eigen_values)
log_eigen[sorted_indices] #the five last values are extremely negative
```

v. Create the weighting matrix, `W` (it is the sorted eigenvectors)  
```{python}
#Create the weighting matrix, `W`
W = eigen_vectors[:,sorted_indices]
```

vi. Create the projected data, `Z`, $Z = XW$ - (you can check you did everything right by checking whether the $X$ you get from $X = ZW^T$ is equal to your original $X$, `np.isclose` may be of help)'
```{python}
#Create the projected data, `Z`
Z  = scaled_data @ W #where scaled data is my X

#check But bro does not make sense 
X_check = Z @ W.T #how to make X
np.isclose(X_check, scaled_data)  # needs to be TRUE,
```


vii. Create a new covariance matrix of the principal components (n=102) - plot it! What has happened off-diagonal and why?

The sporadic off-diagonal activation has been reduced efficiently.
There is almost no covariance left in the matrix of the principal components, i.e most of the 102 principal components do not explain the same variance. 

If they explained the same variance, we wouldn't use them, we'd want them to explain different things. 

 *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* 

```{python}
# Create the eigen covariance matrix 
eigen_cov_mat = np.cov(Z.T)

#plot the eigen cov_mat of the principal components (n=102)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.imshow(eigen_cov_mat)
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Covariance matrix of the principal components (n=102)")
plt.xlabel('Principal Components')
plt.ylabel('Principal Components')
plt.show()
```




# EXERCISE 2 - Use logistic regression with cross-validation to find the optimal number of principal components  

1) We are going to run logistic regression with in-sample validation 
    i. First, run standard logistic regression (no regularization) based on $Z_{d \times k}$ and `y` (the target vector). Fit (`.fit`) 102 models based on: $k = [1, 2, ..., 101, 102]$ and $d = 102$. For each fit get the classification accuracy, (`.score`), when applied to $Z_{d \times k}$ and $y$. This is an in-sample validation. Use the solver `newton-cg` if the default solver doesn't converge'
    
```{python, results = false}
## run logistic regression with in-sample validation 
scores_1 = []
logReg = LogisticRegression(penalty ='none', solver= 'newton-cg', random_state=1) 

#loop through 102 models NORMAL SCORE
for i in range(102):
  logReg.fit(Z[:,0:i+1], y) #
  fit_score = logReg.score(Z[:,0:i+1], y)
  scores_1.append(fit_score)


# minimum and maximum values
np.min(scores_1)
np.max(scores_1)
```


ii. Make a plot with the number of principal components on the _x_-axis and classification accuracy on the _y_-axis - what is the general trend and why is this so?

```{python}
#plot 1 (only logistic regression), x=  principal components (102), y= classification accuracy
plt.figure()
plt.plot(scores_1)
plt.xlabel("principal components")
plt.ylabel("classification accuracy score")
plt.title("Plot 1. Classification accuracy score given principal component")
plt.show()
```
    

iii. In terms of classification accuracy, what is the effect of adding the five last components? Why do you think this is so?

Adding the five last components have very little effect as visualised in the plot. This is because they have projected out of the data .... (???)

 *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* 

```{python}



```
    

2) Now, we are going to use cross-validation - we are using `cross_val_score` and `StratifiedKFold` from `sklearn.model_selection`
i. Define the variable: `cv = StratifiedKFold()` and run `cross_val_score` (remember to set the `cv` argument to your created `cv` variable). Use the same `estimator` in `cross_val_score` as in Exercise 2.1.i. Find the mean score over the 5 folds (the default of `StratifiedKFold`) for each $k$, $k = [1, 2, ..., 101, 102]$  
```{python, results = false}
# Define the variable: `cv = StratifiedKFold()`
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5) 

## use cross-validation this time
cv_scores = []
logReg = LogisticRegression(penalty ='none', solver= 'newton-cg', random_state=1) 

#loop through 102 models NORMAL SCORE
for i in range(102):
  logReg.fit(Z[:,0:i+1], y) 
  cross_val_scores = cross_val_score(logReg, Z[:,0:i+1], y, cv=cv) #cv being 5
  cv_scores.append(np.mean(cross_val_scores))
```

```{python}
# minimum and maximum values
np.min(cv_scores)
np.max(cv_scores)

```
    

ii. Make a plot with the number of principal components on the _x_-axis and classification accuracy on the _y_-axis - how is this plot different from the one in Exercise 2.1.ii?

In plot 1 it looks like the classification accuracy score gradually becomes better when adding a principle component at each fit. Using cross validation when fitting the logistic regression, plot 2 shows a more accurate distribution of the classification accuracy score for the principle components, since we cross validate with 5 folds, and therefore let the model train and test 5 times on different parts of the data . This way we get a better indication of how well our model will perform on data it has not seen before, unlike running logistic regression with in-sample validation. 
Note, the scale of classification score on the y-axis is very different from plot 1 and plot 2, in plot 1 it ranges from around 0.27 to 0.63, while in plot 2 it ranges from 0.23 to 0.37.

 *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* 

```{python}
#plot 2 (using cross validation), x=  principal components (102), y= classification accuracy
plt.figure()
plt.plot(cv_scores)
plt.axvline(np.argmax(cv_scores), color= "red") 
plt.xlabel("principal components")
plt.ylabel("classification accuracy score")
plt.title("Plot 2. Classification accuracy score given principal component, using CV")
plt.show()
```
    

iii. What is the number of principal components, $k_{max\_accuracy}$, that results in the greatest classification accuracy when cross-validated?  

The first 16 principle components (indexed from 0) result in the greatest classification accuracy when cross-validated. 

```{python}
#the maximal cross validation score the model
np.amax(cv_scores) #0.3688291139240506
np.argmax(cv_scores)  # PC 15 
```
    

iv. How many percentage points is the classification accuracy increased with relative to the to the full-dimensional, $d$, dataset 

The increase of classification accuracy in percentage points is 7%. 

```{python}
# Runing cross validation model on full dimensional data
full_data_cv_scores = cross_val_score(logReg, scaled_data, y, cv=cv)
np.mean(full_data_cv_scores) #0.2903164556962025

#the maximal cross validation score the model (for comparison)
np.amax(cv_scores) #0.3688291139240506

#increase of classification accuracy in percentage points
np.amax(cv_scores) -np.mean(full_data_cv_scores)  #0.07851265822784809
```
    

v. How do the analyses in Exercises 2.1 and 2.2 differ from one another? Make sure to comment on the differences in optimization criteria.

 *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what do you mean lau <3 <<3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* 
  *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* 
   *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* 

```{python}

```
    

3) We now make the assumption that $k_{max\_accuracy}$ is representative for each time sample (we only tested for 248 ms). We will use the PCA implementation from _scikit-learn_, i.e. import `PCA` from `sklearn.decomposition`.

i. For __each__ of the 251 time samples, use the same estimator and cross-validation as in Exercises 2.1.i and 2.2.i. Run two analyses - one where you reduce the dimensionality to $k_{max\_accuracy}$ dimensions using `PCA` and one where you use the full data. Remember to scale the data (for now, ignore if you get some convergence warnings - you can try to increase the number of iterations, but this is not obligatory) 

```{python}

```
    
ii. Plot the classification accuracies for each time sample for the analysis with PCA and for the one without in the same plot. Have time (ms) on the _x_-axis and classification accuracy on the _y_-axis 

```{python}

```
    

iii. Describe the differences between the two analyses - focus on the time interval between 0 ms and 400 ms - describe in your own words why the logistic regression performs better on the PCA-reduced dataset around the peak magnetic activity  

```{python}

```
